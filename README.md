# DIY DS-1 Clone

This project is a custom-built clone of the iconic **BOSS DS-1 Distortion Pedal**, one of the most well-known and widely used distortion pedals in guitar history.

## Why I Designed This?
BOSS has transitioned all of their modern DS-1 production to surface mount componenets (SMD), which makes the newer pedals:
- Much harder to mod or repair
- Difficult for beginners to understand or reverse-engineer
